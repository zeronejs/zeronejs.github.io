zerone = zero => one, From 0 to 1, it helps front-end developers to develop Node modules quickly.

## Installation
First, you can use the `Zerone CLI` to scaffold your project

To build your project using `Zerone CLI`, run the following command. This will create a new project directory, creating a traditional infrastructure for your project. It is recommended that first-time users create new projects using `Zerone CLI`. We will continue to use this approach in Quickstart.
```shell
    npm i -g @zeronejs/cli
    zerone new project-name
```

Open the project installation dependency and run it

```shell
    cd project-name
    yarn
    yarn start
```
