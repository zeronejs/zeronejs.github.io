## generate
Typically, during development, every time we create a table, we need to create a CRUD interface or service associated with it, which is a lot of C/V operations, creating multiple
File, which involves multiple operations such as renaming, is a waste of time and no technical improvement.

And when junior developers do this, they often get stuck due to low-level mistakes like copying or renaming.

`generate`is designed to help developers reduce rework and help you get things done over a cup of tea. And the code generated by the program is named correctly, there will be no low-level errors.
<!-- ::: tip
您仅需写一个表结构，执行一行命令，即可生成 CRUD
::: -->
`generate`reads all *.entity.ts files in the current command line directory and generates cruDS associated with them, all you need to do is write a table structure.
::: tip
The generated Module class needs to be imported into the root Module.
:::

```bash
Usage: zerone generate|g [options]

Generate a Zerone CRUD element

Options:
  -h, --help  Output usage information.
```

## build

It compiles ts files in packaged projects, which differ from `tsc` in that it can copy other files such as package.json, etc.
::: tip
This is helpful if you are a library developer.

But in real development, you may not need it, so use `npm run build`。
:::

```bash
Usage: zerone build [options]

ts is packaged as js

Options:
  -h, --help  Output usage information.
