```

## api

Read the documentation of swagger (v3) and generate the corresponding ts code
::: tip
This is helpful if you are a front-end developer.
:::

```bash
Usage: zerone api [options]

Generate Swagger Api

Options:
  -d, --delete       Delete files generated before this module.
  -js, --javascript  Generate JavaScript code.
  -p, --path <path>  Specifies the path to the "swagger.config.json" folder
                     (relative to the command line).
  -h, --help         Output usage information.
```

- **step 1**: You need to add a `swagger.config.json` configuration file where the api is generated
  > Configuration example
  >
  > ```ts
  > {
  >     "docsUrl": "http://www.example.com/v3/api-docs",
  >     "includeTags": [],
  >     "excludeTags": ["bot-callback-controller"],
  >     "axiosInstanceUrl": "@/utils/request",
  >     "prefix": ""
  >     "vueUseAxios": true,
  > }
  > ```
- **step 2**: run command

```bash
zerone api

## info

Output information about the current system and dependencies.

Use this command whenever you want to check your environment or submit an Issue.

```bash
zerone info
```

## new

Create a new Zerone project.

```bash
Usage: zerone new|n [options] [name]

Generate New Zerone application.

Options:
  -h, --help  Output usage information.
```

## generate

Typically, during development, every time we create a table, we need to create a CRUD interface or service associated with it, which is a lot of C/V operations, creating multiple
File, which involves multiple operations such as renaming, is a waste of time and no technical improvement.

And when junior developers do this, they often get stuck due to low-level mistakes like copying or renaming.

`generate`is designed to help developers reduce rework and help you get things done over a cup of tea. And the code generated by the program is named correctly, there will be no low-level errors.

<!-- ::: tip
您仅需写一个表结构，执行一行命令，即可生成 CRUD
::: -->

`generate`reads all \*.entity.ts files in the current command line directory and generates CRUD associated with them, all you need to do is write a [table structure](https://typeorm.io/#/entities).
::: tip
The generated Module class needs to be imported into the root Module.
:::

```bash
Usage: zerone generate|g [options]

Generate a Zerone CRUD element

Options:
  -d, --delete       Delete files generated before this module.
  -p, --path <path>  Specifies the path to the "entities" folder (relative to the command line).
  -h, --help         Output usage information.
```

## build

It compiles ts files in packaged projects, which differ from `tsc` in that it can copy other files such as package.json, etc.
::: tip
This is helpful if you are a library developer.

But in real development, you may not need it, so use `npm run build`。
:::

```bash
Usage: zerone build [options]

ts is packaged as js

Options:
  -p, --path <path>  Specify the path of the folder where "tsconfig.json" is located.
  -d, --delete       Delete files specified by "outDir".
  -h, --help         Output usage information.
```
