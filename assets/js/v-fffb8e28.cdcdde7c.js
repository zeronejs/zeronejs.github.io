But Nuxt is designed for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.</p><h3 id="vitepress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vitepress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VitePress</h3><p>VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It&#39;s also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It&#39;s even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it&#39;s more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don&#39;t need advanced customizations.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.</p><h3 id="docsify-docute" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#docsify-docute" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Docsify / Docute</h3><p>Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don’t care for SEO and don’t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.</p><h3 id="hexo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hexo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hexo</h3><p>Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo’s Markdown rendering isn’t the most flexible to configure.</p><h3 id="gitbook" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gitbook" aria-hidden="true">#</a> GitBook</h3><p>We’ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.</p>',12),D={},M=(0,r(3744).Z)(D,[["render",function(e,t){const r=(0,o.up)("OutboundLink");return(0,o.wg)(),(0,o.iD)(o.HY,null,[n,(0,o._)("p",null,[a,(0,o._)("a",i,[s,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),d]),l,h,(0,o._)("p",null,[u,(0,o._)("a",c,[p,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),g,(0,o._)("a",f,[m,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),k]),(0,o._)("p",null,[w,(0,o._)("a",b,[y,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),v]),x,(0,o._)("p",null,[V,(0,o._)("a",_,[P,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),U,W,j,(0,o._)("a",H,[T,(0,o.Wm)(r)]),I]),B],64)}]])},3744:(e,t)=>{t.Z=(e,t)=>{for(const[r,o]of t)e[r]=o;return e}}}]);
